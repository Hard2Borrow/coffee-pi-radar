In terms of deviating from reference design, let's review the signal chain

    - Modulator Circuit
    - VCO
    - Tx Amplifier
    - Cantenna1
    - Cantenna2
    - Rx LNA
    - Mixer
    - Video Amp
    - LPF

I am skipping the last two steps - Video Amp and LPF. However, I'm using a quality audio interface as well, since the USB interface wasn't working. The Focusrite (audio adapter) has both variable gain (knobs) and low-pass filtering. It's a better solution all the way around. As far as putting it in the PCB... I'm not sure why I couldn't get it to work. Could be one of three things

    1. The quad op-amp got damaged or was otherwise made inoperable.
    2. There was a mistake in the circuit
    3. The operator (me) was doing something wrong.
