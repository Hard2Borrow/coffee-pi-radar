## Abstract:

#### Lincoln's original
"Doppler radar technology is widely used today to capture data that is meaningful for us. The data is examined for the speed and direction of moving objects relative to an observer. It is widely used in radar gun, aviation and healthcare. This project seeks to develop each phase for Doppler Rader instrument for moving objects. The phases to be considered are transmitting and receiving reflected waves. These waves will be timed to capture the velocity over a known distance."

#### Paul's mods
"Doppler radar is an older technology that is finding renewed interest with modern computing hardware and software advances. It is widely used in applications like weather forecasting, law enforcement, aerospace, and healthcare. The technology exploits the Doppler effect to remotely capture data about a moving object's velocity. Additionally, system-on-a-chip technology is continually making it easier to deploy complicated embedded systems. This project will leverage the Cantenna Radar project developed by Dr. Gregory Charvat at MIT interfaced via a sound card to a Raspberry Pi to develop and deploy a simple, real-time Doppler Radar. The system will be used to measure, log, and analyze the speed of vehicles on a residential street over time."
